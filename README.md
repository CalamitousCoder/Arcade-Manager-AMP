# Arcade-Manager-AMP
 My largest personal project. The program allows a user to manage their arcade’s revenue, machines, and employees. It primarily uses classes, objects, methods, and Arraylists. I’m still expanding the program. My next goals are creating a basic UI to make navigation less clunky and allowing users to create new employees &amp; machines via a hashmap.
